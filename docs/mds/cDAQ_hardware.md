The NI‑9866 excels in applications requiring real-time, high-speed manipulation of hundreds of LIN frames and signals such as hardware‑in‑the‑loop (HIL) simulation, rapid control prototyping, bus monitoring, automation control, and more.  You can perform this manipulation while taking other DAQ measurements in the same CompactDAQ hardware platform or while performing low-level FPGA control and embedded monitoring in the same CompactRIO Chassis. |

The NI‑9862 excels in applications requiring real-time, high-speed manipulation of hundreds of CAN frames and signals, such as hardware‑in‑the‑loop simulation, rapid control prototyping, bus monitoring, automation control, and more.  You can perform this manipulation while taking other data acquisition measurements in the same NI CompactDAQ hardware platform or while performing low-level FPGA control and embedded monitoring in the same NI CompactRIO chassis. |

The NI‑DAQmx and NI‑RIO drivers are shipped with default master/slave configurations for quick synchronization applications, but you can also customize the routing of the trigger and clock lines between the inports, outports, and chassis to create large-scale systems with custom timing and triggering.  The NI‑9469 was designed to synchronize modules with simultaneous delta‑sigma A/D converters for high‑channel‑count systems that require more than one chassis. In addition to delta‑sigma synchronization, you can program the four input lines and eight output lines (four per port) of the NI‑9469 for custom trigger schemes. |
